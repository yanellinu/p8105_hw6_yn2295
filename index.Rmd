The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) of the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) provides public access to weather data including the Global Historical Climatology Network. The GHCN is a daily database of summary statistics from weather stations around the world, and it contains records from over 100,000 stations in 180 countries and territories. NCEI provides numerous daily variables, including maximum and minimum temperature, total daily precipitation, snowfall, and snow depth. However, the record length and period of record vary by station and cover intervals ranging from less than a year to more than 175 year.  A more detailed description of the data can be found [here](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ghcn-daily-description). For our assessment, we are focusing on weather information recorded by stations located in New York only. 

Through our exploratory study, we are interested on determine whether lower temperatures are associated with higher levels of precipitation. Thus, we focus on the years 1981 to 1989 to include the 1983 blizzard that produce abnormally high levels of rain. We limited the variables to temperature, snow, year, month, and precipitation. Furthermore, the temperature and precipitation variables were converted to millimeters and Celsius respectively as the NOAA provides them as tenths of millimeters and tenths of Celsius. The dataset use for this assessment was accessed from the [NOAA National Climatic Data Center](http://doi.org/10.7289/V5D21VHZ) on August 15 2017.

In the dashboard subheading you can find graphics for monthly precipitation patterns in NYC from 1981-1989 as well as, minimum temperature ranges from these same years, and a smoothline graph of the relationship between temperature and precipitation. Additionally, my collaborator and I have created an interactive shiny application where the user can explore the precipitation outcomes depending on temperature and snow fall. This dashboard can be access [here](https://lizzyagibson.shinyapps.io/p8105_hw_yn2295_shiny/) and the github respository for this dashboard can be access [here](https://github.com/lizzyagibson/p8105_hw_yn2295_shiny).
